# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Architecture Diagram
This week we discussed the importance of diagrams. Providing a conceptual image of what we wish to build. It doesn't have to be low level in the beginning with ARNs or anything. The more comfortable we are with the stack, the more we can be specific in the diagram. I used LucidCharts to recreate the full diagram and downloaded the [AWS Icons PPT](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-aws-simple-icons-for-your-architecture-diagrams/) from the inter-webs.

## Gitpod
For the AWS Bootcamp, we have the option to either use GitHub Codespaces or Gitpod. Both come with a Free Tier. I decided to go with Gitpod and I connected it as an OAUTH app to my GitHub account. Gitpod is a Cloud Development Environment. Basically a containerized environment that is cloud hosted. The concept is pretty great! Give developers or users an environment without all of the bloatware to install and run whatever packages they want without impacting their local hosts. I also like the ability to save global variables for the repo that are stored in Gitpod and not somewhere in my repo, this includes AWS Secrets!
